Basic projection:-

--------------------------Step1) Login funlity------------------------------------

Work:- Only the registered user will be authenticated, if user is not registered,
       then redirect him/her on registration page

Fields:- Username, password or Login with google or login with facebook (Any 2)

--------------------------Step2) Asking for art preference-------------------------

Work:- Here user will sort the art types, just like pinterest, and whatever the
       user will sort, he/she will only be able to see the related art,
       user can also add/remove the arts from there preference section

Fields:- All art fields, but with the search bar top above the art list

--------------------------Step3) Creation of feed page-----------------------------

Work:- Now here we comes up with the catchy consept, we are not giving the access
       to user to follow someone, here what we're gonna do is, whatever the 
       preferences user had given to us, we just have to show them art from 
       various artists(Make sure the related arts only!)

Fields:- We have to discuss this, it will depend upon the UI of application
         but the basic funcs are: 1) like, 2) marketplace, 3) talk with artist,
         4) add art, 5) trending art

Branches:- If user selected for the trending art, then user will get the options
           releted to his/her preference and only then the user will be able to see
           the trendig art(Note:- The user trend number will be shown on top)
                                
                                Getting over it

               We can also add the funclity called, improve your skill

We also have to make a competition between the artist and the winner will get 
featured on the timeline or on the trending list,
there will be 2 diff kind of arts like 1) solo art, 2) collab art the result
for both the categories will be different.
the result of the art will be guessed from the votes, so we have to create the 
voting page too, where what people will do is they can search the name of the
artist by username and there the voter will get the option to vote the artist,
and the artist will be able to see by whome he/she got to be voted.

--------------------------Step4) Competition page------------------------------------

Work:- Here what we're gonna do is we'll flash a notification for the
       user to get participated if the user clicked on participate option
       then he has to add the image of his/her art, and a bit discription
       about the art, and after participating he'll be able to see by whome 
       he got the votes, just below the notification.


The reason behind the votes is to capture the market attention towards our application
